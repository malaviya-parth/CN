# Digital Signals

**Digital signals** are signals that can take on only a finite number of values. The most common digital signals are binary signals, which can take on only two values, 0 and 1.

## Terminologies of Digital Signals

1. Bit Interval: The time required to send one bit is called the bit interval. It is the inverse of the bit rate.
    - For Above given graph, bit interval is 0.25 sec.

2. Bit Rate: The number of bits sent in one second, also known as the bit rate, is the most common measure of transmission speed. The bit rate is usually expressed in bits per second (bps).
   - For the above given graph, bit rate is 4 bps.

3. Bit Length: The length of a bit is called the bit length. It is the distance traveled by light in one bit time.
    - For the above given graph, bit length = 0.25 * 3 * 10^8 = 75,000,000 m.

## Analogies with Analog Signals

1. Bit Rate is analogous to frequency.
2. Bit Length is analogous to wavelength.
3. Bit Interval is analogous to period.

## Q. Find the bit length, if bit rate is 6 Mbps.

- Bit length = c / bit rate
  - c = 3 * 10^8 m/s
  - bit rate = 6 * 10^6 bps
  - bit length = 3 * 10^8 / 6 * 10^6 = 50 m
- Bit length is 50 m.
- Bit interval = 1 / bit rate = 1 / 6 * 10^6 = 0.167 micro sec.

## Q. Find the bit rate, if onr bit last for 1 micro sec on Transmission medium.

- Bit rate = 1 / bit interval = 1 / 1 micro sec = 1 Mbps
