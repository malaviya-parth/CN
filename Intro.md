- Earlier more & more computers were installed in different plalces of world. Need was to trasfer data between them.
- Floppy Disks and Tape drivers were used to transfer data, which wasn't efficient.
- Later started to connect them through wired networks.
- There are issues while transfering data through wired networks like:
  - Data transfer rate is slow.
  - Different format of data.
  - Binary data to Signals
  - Who can access channel when
- For all this we need a Network model which can handle all the issues related to data transfer b/w computers.
- There are layers in the Network model which perform subtasks to transfer data.
