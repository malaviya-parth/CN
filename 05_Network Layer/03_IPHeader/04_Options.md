## Options
- THere are two types of IPv4 options: Single byte and Multiple byte.
- There are single byte option field
  - **No operation:** It is used as a filler & is used to make header multiple of 4 bytes.(Helps in HLEN representation.)
  - **End of Options:** As the name suggests it is the last byte of options & after it payload starts.
- There are also multiple byte options
  - **Record Route:** It is used to record IP addresses of router that handles the datagram & can store upto 9 router addresses.
    - It is used in debugging & management of N/W.
    - In the datagram the router fills their own IP address and this is how route is recorded.
    - It is a 4 byte field, and as can stor upto 9 addresses so it can take upto 36 bytes in options.
  - **Strict Source Route:** Source will decide the route & that will be strict
    - It is useful because sender can choose a specific type of service like min. delay, max throughput etc.
    - If SSR is specified then only those routes will be visited which are in the list.
    - If datagram visits a router whose address is missing in the list then it is discarded.
    - Packet will be discarded even if all the routers are not visited.
  - Loose Source Route: Same as SSR but datagram can visit routes which are not in the list.
    - But datagram must visit all the routers in the list otherwise it will be discarded.
  - **Time Stamp:** It is used to record the time of datagram processing by a router.
    - It can help users & managers to track behavior of router in internet.
    - We can estimate the time it takes for a datagram to go from one router to another.
