# Network Layer

- Network Layer is responsible for Host to Host delivery of the packet.
- Here we call the packet as a Datagram.
- Header of Dartagram contain IP address of both Sender & Receiver
- IP address is of 32 bits (IPv4), Another is IPv6 of 128 bits.
- As 32 bits are there so total number of IP address possible are $2^{32}$.

## Notation of IP Address
1. Binary Notation
   - 00110010.0010001000.10000001.00101101
2. Dotted Decimal Notation
   - 50.36.129.45
3. Hexadecimal Notation
   - 0x32.0x24.0x81.0x2d

## Question
No of IP address in Range if 1st address = 136.45.49.5 & last address = 136.45.49.7

### Solution
- 3

## Question
No of IP address in Range if 1st address = 136.45.49.5 & last address = 136.45.50.45

### Solution
- 256*(50-49) + 45 - 5 + 1 = 297

## Question
No of IP address in Range if 1st address = 136.45.49.5 & last address = 136.47.50.45

### Solution
- $256\times 256\times(47-45) + 256\times(50-49) + 45 - 5 + 1$ = 131072 + 256 + 41 = 131369

## Question
No of IP address in Range if 1st address = 136.45.83.92 & last address = 136.47.45.60

### Solution
- $256\times 256\times(47-45) + 256\times(45-83) + 60 - 92 + 1$ = 131072 - 9728 - 32 + 1 = 121313

## Question
Find Bitwise NOT,OR and AND of IP address: 25.36.45.50 and 129.255.45.0

### Solution
- 255.255.255.255 - 25.36.45.50 = 230.219.210.205
- OR = (do by binary).255.(do by binary).50
- AND = (do by binary).36.(do by binary).0
