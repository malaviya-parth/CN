# Random Access Protocol

- No station is superior to other and none station is assigned control over others, i.e. no station permits or stops other stations from transmitting data.
- This means station can send data whenever it wants.
- To avoid collision station must send data by executing a procedure or condition defined by the protocol.
- Because there is no fix order in which stations can send data, hence this protocol is called random access protocol.
- Each station competes for the channel hence this protocol is also called contention protocol.
