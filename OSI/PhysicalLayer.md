## Functions

1. Physical Characteristics(Copper,glass, plastic, etc.) of media and it's type(Wired or Wireless).
2. Representation of bits.
    - Signal Encoding
3. Data Rate/ Transmission Rate / Bit Duration
    - No. of bits sent per second.
    - Bit Duration: How long a bit last on transmission media.
    - If Data rate = 1000 bits/sec, then bit duration = 1/1000 sec = 1 msec.
4. Synchronization of bits.
    - Sender and Receiver block must be synchronized at bit level.
5. Line COnfiguration
    - How nodes are connected to media.
      -  Point to Point: 2 nodes are connected by a dedicated link.
      -  Multipoint: More than 2 nodes are connected by a shared link.
6. Topology
   - How network is laid out physically.
   - Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh, Tree, Hybrid.
7. Transmission Mode
   - Simplex: One way communication.
     - Achieved by using 1 pair of wires.
   - Half Duplex: Two way communication but only one way at a time.
     - Achieved by using 1 pair of wires.
   - Full Duplex: Two way communication at the same time.
     - Achieved by using 2 pairs of wires.

## For Mesh Topology how many links are required to connect n nodes?
- n(n-1)/2
