## TCP Timers
1. Time Wait Timer
2. Keep Alive Timer
3. Persistent Timer
4. Acknowledgement Timer
5. Time Out Timer ‚≠ê

## Time Wait Timer
- When the TCP client peer want to terminate the connection, it sends FIN.
- Now, after receiving FIN from server, the client sets of Time Wait Timer equal to 2*MSL, then terminates the connection after timer expiration.

## Keep Alive Timer:
- A keepalive timer is used in some implementations to prevent a long idle connection between two TCPs.
- Suppose that a client opens a TCP connection to a server, transfers some data, and becomes silent. Perhaps the client has crashed.
- In this case, the connection remains open forever.
- To remedy this situation, most implementations equip a server with a keepalive timer.
- Each time the server hears from a client, it resets this timer. The time-out is usually 2 hours.
- If the server does not hear from the client after 2 hours, it sends a probe segment.
- If there is no response after 10 probes, each of which is 75 seconds apart, it assumes that the client is down and terminates the connection.

## Persistent Timer
- It is used in Flow control.
- When receiver sends WS = 0, persistent timer is set to some value.
- When persistent timer expires, sender sends a probe packet to know whether now the receiver is able to get data or not.

## Acknowledgement Timer
- Used if data comes, ACK packet wait for ACK timer so that if piggybacking is possible then it can be performed.
- If ACK timer expires then pure ACK is sent.

## Time out Timer / Retransmission Timer
- At DLL we have studied about Time Out Timer & it was easy to find because DLL work Hop to Hop.
- RTT = 2 * Tp
- TOT = 2 * RTT
- But at transport layer it will be difficult to find Time out because end to end.
- 3 Issues:
  - Finding Tp,TT,QT,PT, etc of each node is difficult
  - Segments are encapsulated in datagram & it may travel via different path so some times RTT decreases and some time RTT increases.
  - At different time we have different amount of traffic like at 6 am 10 ms and at 6 pm 40 ms.
  - Considering all these factors, static Time out timer will not work for TCP.
  - We need dynamic Time out timer for TCP which can increase or decrease according to the traffic.
