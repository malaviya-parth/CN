# Error Detection & Correction

## Error
- If the data received by the receiver is different from the data sent by the sender, then it is called an error.
- 2 type of error:
  - Single bit error
  - Burst error

## Question
- If the data rate is 1 Mbps, and Noise came for 1 ms, then how many bits will be affected?
- Ans: $\frac{10^6}{10^3} = 10^3$ bits

## Error Detection
- The process of detecting the error is called error detection.
- The error detection is done by adding some extra bits to the data.
- The extra bits are called redundant bits.
- The data along with the redundant bits is called codeword.
- The codeword is sent to the receiver.
- The receiver checks the codeword for error detection.

## Error Correction
- The process of correcting the error is called error correction.
- The error correction is done by adding some extra bits to the data.
- The extra bits are called redundant bits.
- The data along with the redundant bits is called codeword.
- The codeword is sent to the receiver.
- The receiver checks the codeword for error correction.
- The receiver corrects the error if it is present.

## Detection vs Correction

| Detection | Correction |
| --- | --- |
| Easier | Difficult |
| Redundant bits are less | Redundant bits are more |
| Takes less time | Takes more time |
