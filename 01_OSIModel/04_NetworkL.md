# Network Layer
- It is responsible for Host to Host delivery of the packet called as Datagram.

## Functions of Network Layer

1. Logical Addresing:- Header of Network Layer contain Logical Address of Sender and Receiver.

2. Routing:- Routing means to route the packet to final destination. We have various Routing protocols which work on Network Layer.

3. Quality of Service:- QoS is a set of techniques to manage network resources. There are certain techniques to manage network resources like
    - Reliability:- More
    - Delay:- Less
    - Jitter:- 
      - Variation in timing of receiving packets
      - Should be Less
    - Bandwidth:- More

4. Congestion Control:- If number of packets present in the network is greater than the No. of packets it can handle then it is called as Congestion.

5. Fragmentation and Reassembly:- If MTU(Maximum Transmission Unit) of Network is less than the size of packet then packet is divided into fragments and then reassembled at the destination.
