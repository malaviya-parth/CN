# Why OSI Model Failed

- The OSI model was a theoretical model that was never implemented in the real world. It was too complex and expensive to implement. The TCP/IP model was developed as a simplified model that could be implemented in the real world. The TCP/IP model is the model that is used today.

## Three main reasons

1. Bad timing: The OSI model was developed at a time when the computer industry was very different from what it is today. Also TCP/IP was already in use when the OSI model was developed.

2. Bad implementation: The OSI model was too complex and expensive to implement.

3. Bad Technology: The OSI model was based on the idea that the computer industry would be dominated by mainframe computers. The computer industry is now dominated by personal computers.

4. Bad Politics: The OSI model was developed by a committee of people from different companies. The committee was unable to agree on a single model. The OSI model was never implemented because of this.
